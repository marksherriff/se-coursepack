Welcome to "An Introduction to Software Engineering!"  This coursepack was created by Prof. Will McBurney and [Prof. Mark Sherriff](http://marksherriff.com).  This site is ever growing and evolving as we add and improve material with each semester.

The material in this coursepack comes from CS 3240: Advanced Software Development Techniques course offered by the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) in the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/) at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu).

__Course Information:__

Starting in Fall 2025, current semester information will be maintained in UVACanvas.  General information about the course structure will be posted here, along with the current coursepack information.
