Continuous integration is critical to keep your builds current and running smoothly. For our environment, we will be using GitHub Actions + Heroku to make the magic happen! Todayâ€™s lecture will be a live tutorial on how to get this setup, what everything means, and how continuous integration will help your project.

_Note: The terms "black-box" and "white-box" testing have been updated to "closed-box" and "open-box," per guidance from the ACM's Diversity and Inclusion Council.
