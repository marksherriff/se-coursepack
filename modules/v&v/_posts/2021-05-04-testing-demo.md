So you understand closed-box and open-box conceptually, but donâ€™t know how you would use it in development?

This video shows a practical demonstration of test-driven development, as well as where you would do both black-box and white-box testing in development unit-testing.

_Note: The terms "black-box" and "white-box" testing have been updated to "closed-box" and "open-box," per guidance from the ACM's Diversity and Inclusion Council.
