What is the different between verification and validation, and how do they relate to insuring our software works correctly? And who does it work correctly for.

Verification and Validation are vital concepts to a software engineering, as we want to ensure our product is correct. But correct for the developers may not be the same as correct for the customer. In this lecture, we compare and contrast verification and validation, and discuss strategies to improve both, and avoid mistakes, errors, defects, and failures along the way.

_Note: The terms "black-box" and "white-box" testing have been updated to "closed-box" and "open-box," per guidance from the ACM's Diversity and Inclusion Council.
