We are using an MVC framework (Django) for our projects. But what does that actually mean?

It turns out that the concept of using MVC for web applications is “the end of the story.” So, we need to go back to the beginning. Why do we use MVC frameworks? What other architectural design patterns exist in and around MVC to make it work the way it does?

This lecture serves as an introduction and overview to a few different key patterns:

* Three-tier Architecture
* Client-Server (including Thick vs. Thin)
* Infrastructure-as-a-Service vs. Platform-as-a-Service vs. Software-as-a-Service

This will give you the basics you need to see how your project fits in the grander scheme of web-based applications.
