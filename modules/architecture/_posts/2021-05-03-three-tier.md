How does a well implemented architecture improve code maintainability?

In this lecture, I show how a 3-tier architecture can be used to improve code maintainability, by limiting the propagation of change in software. We talk about a few additional design patterns, but mostly focus on a 3-tier architecture (User Interface Layer, Business Layer, Data Layer) and look at Java Code that includes a simple demonstration of a 3-tier architecture.
