An architectural design pattern is an accepted solution to a known problem.

A three-tier architecture separates presentation from application logic from the data model in a software system. Abstractly, this could apply to both high-level and low-level designs. Model / View / Controller is a particular implementation of a three-tier architecture at the code level. Multiple code frameworks follow the MVC pattern so that developers can more easily create software systems that are understandable and extendable.
