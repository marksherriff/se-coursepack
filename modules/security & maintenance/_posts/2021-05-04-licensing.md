When you buy software, you almost always buy a license to use the software, rather than the rights to the software itself. But you frequently do not have rights to reverse engineering, change, or improve the software.

Many developers started the free software movement in response to encourage software to allow these rights. What does "free software" mean? And how can licensing of "free software" affect how you release your own project? To what extent are you allowed to commercialize the works of others? In the lecture video, we will answer these questions.
