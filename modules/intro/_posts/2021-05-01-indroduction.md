# Introduction

Welcome to "An Introduction to Software Engineering!"  This coursepack was created by Prof. Will McBurney and [Prof. Mark Sherriff](http://marksherriff.com) from the videos and course materials created during the switch to online instruction due to COVID-19.  

The material in this coursepack comes from [CS 3240: Advanced Software Development Techniques](http://cs3240.cs.virginia.edu) offered by the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) in the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/) at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu).
