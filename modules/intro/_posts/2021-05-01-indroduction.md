# Introduction

Welcome to "An Introduction to Software Engineering!"  This coursepack was created by Prof. Will McBurney and [Prof. Mark Sherriff](http://marksherriff.com) from the videos and course materials created during the switch to online instruction due to COVID-19.  

The material in this coursepack comes from [CS 3240: Advanced Software Development Techniques](https://f22.cs3240.org) offered by the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) in the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/) at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu).

# Where did this material come from?

This coursepack was created from materials refined over years of teaching software engineering at the University of Virginia.  While Prof. Mark Sherriff and Prof. Will McBurney are the primary authors of this material, we would like to recognize others that have contributed slides, ideas, and concepts directly to this course:

* Prof. Tom Horton (University of Virginia)
* Prof. Walker White (Cornell University)
* Prof. Sarah Heckman (NC State University)
* Prof. Laurie Williams (NC State University)
* Prof. Chris Murphy (Bryn Mawr College)

The video content in this coursepack was created as a part of the move to remote learning during the 2020-2021 academic year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The full playlist of videos is available on YouTube on our channel: [http://youtube.com/c/uvacs3240](http://youtube.com/c/uvacs3240)
